	abstract="Numerous approaches for identifying important content for automatic text summarization have been developed to date. Topic representation approaches first derive an intermediate representation of the text that captures the topics discussed in the input. Based on these representations of topics, sentences in the input document are scored for importance. In contrast, in indicator representation approaches, the text is represented by a diverse set of possible indicators of importance which do not aim at discovering topicality. These indicators are combined, very often using machine learning techniques, to score the importance of each sentence. Finally, a summary is produced by selecting sentences in a greedy approach, choosing the sentences that will go in the summary one by one, or globally optimizing the selection, choosing the best set of sentences to form a summary. In this chapter we give a broad overview of existing approaches based on these distinctions, with particular attention on how representation, sentence scoring or summary selection strategies alter the overall performance of the summarizer. We also point out some of the peculiarities of the task of summarization which have posed challenges to machine learning approaches for the problem, and some of the suggested solutions.",

We use our algorithm to train a neural summarization model on the CNN and DailyMail datasets and demonstrate experimentally that it outperforms state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive systems when evaluated automatically and by humans.",

	abstract="Machine translation is an important technology socio-politically, commercially and scientifically, despite many misconceptions about its success or lack of it over the decades. The emergence of the Internet as one of the main media of modern communication has turned translation into a bridge that connects speakers of different languages. The endless traffic of communication between different language groups requires translation, but when instant translations are needed, human translators are not able to supply them fast enough. A highly skilled profession like translation using human translators is expensive and also slow, especially when a large number of languages and subject fields are involved. In order to meet the growing translation demand, machine translation systems are seen as a cost-effective alternative to human translators in a variety of situations. Ever since the first system was built, machine translation has been presenting scientific challenges (see also Nirenburg 1996). It became the testing ground for many experiments and applications for natural-language processing, artificial intelligence and even linguistics (Arnold etal. 1994: 4--5).",
