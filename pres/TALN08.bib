	ABSTRACT = {The task of coreference resolution has attracted considerable attention in the literature due to its importance in deep language understanding and its potential as a subtask in a variety of complex natural language processing problems. In this study, we outlined the field&rsquo;s terminology, describe existing metrics, their differences and shortcomings, as well as the available corpora and external resources. We analyzed existing state-of-the-art models and approaches, and reviewed recent advances and trends in the field, namely end-to-end systems that jointly model different subtasks of coreference resolution, and cross-lingual systems that aim to overcome the challenges of less-resourced languages. Finally, we discussed the main challenges and open issues faced by coreference resolution systems.},
