	abstract="This paper reviews natural language processing (NLP) from the late 1940's to the present, seeking to identify its successive trends as these reflect concerns with different problems or the pursuit of different approaches to solving these problems and building systems as wholes. The review distinguishes four phases in the history of NLP, characterised respectively by an emphasis on machine translation, by the influence of artificial intelligence, by the adoption of a logico-grammatical style, and by an attack on massive language data. The account considers the significant and salient work in each phase, and concludes with an assessment of where we stand after more than forty years of effort in the field.",

Instead, the parser is driven by statistical pattern recognizers, in the form of decision trees, trained on correctly parsed sentences. This approach to grammatical inference results in a parser which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any previously published result.",

We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24{\%} on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100 times more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.",
